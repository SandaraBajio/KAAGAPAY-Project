## 🧑‍💻 II. Application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
### 🔹 How OOP Enhances KAAGAPAY
- **Encapsulation**: Secure handling of sensitive data, such as user information and emergency reports.
- **Inheritance**: Code reuse across multiple modules, like different types of disaster responses (e.g., Flood, Earthquake, Typhoon).
- **Polymorphism**: Flexible integration of various communication channels (SMS, Email, Push Notifications) for disaster alerts.
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex operations such as resource allocation and real-time data analytics.
